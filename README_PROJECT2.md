In this project I used two scanned figures. I used Xbox kinect to scan two people. Then I take the scans to Mesh Mixer and fix it. This project mainly serves as a starting point of a whole new possibility for me to utilize the new media/technology in my art practice. I noticed I have no experienced with 3d modeling software and 3d scanning. I would like to explore this way of creating in the near future. Combining the real world with the virtual reality and bring it back to the real world. I am very interested in the loss of information as well as how we can add new information into the work.\
So this 3d printed object is a combination of two scanned busts, melting into each other creating this new, abstracted form, a little bit typographical, a little bit grotesque. I am very interested in the digital rendering, how the surface is interchangeable and glossy.\
I would love to start making 3d forms, and now I know that I don\'92t need to start from scratch and can utilize objects from the real world.\
